# contacts-list

Site developed with Vue and Vuex. It's a SPA which contains two contact lists. In the first one a JSON is downloaded and you can move contacts from one list to another, edit, delete and add new ones. You can also sort by first name, last name or email. There is also a search engine that allows you to search for contacts by name. 

You can run the demo [here](https://contacts-lists.netlify.app/)
